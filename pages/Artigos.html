                <h3>Copying and Copyright</h3>
                <p>Today most newly created textual, photographic, audio, and video content is available in digital form. Even older content that was not "born digital" can relatively easily converted to machine-readable formats. At same time, the world has become more networked, making it easy to transfer digital content from one person to another. The combination of technological progress in both digitization and computer networking has been a challenge for traditional ways of managing intellectual property. Some observers have even questioned whether current models for intellectual property can or should survive in a digital world. For example, there is widespread concern about piracy of popular music and film, both via the network and via bootleg CDs and DVDs. There is also concern about the economic viability of the current model for scholarly publication, or, for that matter traditional forms of publishing such as newspapers and TV network news. These developments have led to a revival of interest in the economics of copying and copyright. In this brief review we examine some of the economic issues in this area, and describe some of the insights that have emerged from this work. We end with some reflections on alternative business models for provision of creative works. </p>

                <h3>Music and Copyright</h3>
                <p>Copyright lies at the very heart of the music business. Copyright law determines the social framework in which music is marketed, artists are rewarded, and all the uses to which their work is put are licensed. And copyright claims and counter-claims are the source of recurring conflict. Who wrote what and when? Who owns these sounds? What are you allowed to do with them? Disputes about copying and theft are becoming ever noisier with digital technology and the new possibilities of sampling, downloading and large-scale piracy.

                    This book has been written to explain the copyright system to non-legal specialists and to show why copyright issues are so fascinating and so important. Copyright is analysed as a social, economic and legal phenomenon. It is approached from the contrasting perspectives of composers, performers, producers and infringers. Copyright law is seen to be central to the relationship between the global entertainment industry and local musical practices. The questions raised here are not just about music. They concern the very meaning of intellectual property rights in the context of rapid global and technological change. And they are not just about big business. They impinge on all our lives.</p>

                <h3>Authorship and Copyright</h3>
                <p>First published in 1992, Authorship and Copyright traces the history of constructions of authorship as a legal reality. It offers an alternative to the two mainstream interpretations that have traditionally been assigned to authorship: the Romantic dialectical ‚Äòbirth of the author‚Äô or the language-based post-structuralist ‚Äòdeath of the author.‚Äô Saunders examines the shortcomings of both schemes by arguing that they impose an arbitrary philosophical direction on the history of authorship and the law of copyright. Saunders addresses the issues relating to copyright and the construction of authorship as a legal status. Combining information and polemic, the author explores such matters as the historical and theoretical relations of copyright and the droit moral, the aestheticization of the law and the juridification of aesthetics, and the argument that authorship as a legal reality is a historically contingent and variable arrangement that cannot be separated from its cultural and juridical context. This book will be of interest to students of law, literature and philosophy.</p>

                <h3>The Copyright Law of Spatial Data</h3>
                <p>This book provides a thorough comparative analysis of copyright protection of spatial data across Australia, the United States of America (USA), and the European Union.

                    With the emergence of terrestrial scanners, drones, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the acquisition of data has recently reshaped the landscape of the survey industry, highlighting the importance of protecting the intellectual rights of surveyors. This book investigates the distinct approaches taken by each jurisdiction in protecting copyrights in spatial data and explores commonalities and disparities between these jurisdictions, highlighting best practices. The book also explores the alternative means of protecting spatial data and provides final recommendations aimed at policymakers, with the overarching objective of nurturing a balanced copyright system.
                    
                    This book will be of interest to students and scholars in the field of copyright law and spatial data.</p>
